## Ready to get started?

Great! But first, let's get a few things out of the way.

### What is Necomify, and what is it not?

- ✅ **Necomify** is a simple Next.js E-Commerce starter kit that helps you
  build your online store with ease. It comes with pre-built pages, without
  styles, ensuring that you can customize to your needs.

- ❌ **Necomify** is not a full-fledged e-commerce solution. It is a starting point for you to build your store on top of. You can add your own styles, components, and functionality to make it your own.

**Necomify** is not responsible for any legal issues that may arise from using this starter kit. Make sure to comply with all laws and regulations when building your online store.

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

If you don't have these installed, run the following commands in your terminal:
