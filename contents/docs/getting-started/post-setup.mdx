## What's next?

Now that you have set up Necomify for your project, there are a few things you should do before getting to work. Here are a few steps to help you get started:

### 1. Update the project name

The first thing you should do is update the project name in the `package.json` file. This will ensure that your project is correctly identified when you deploy it.

### 2. Update the project description

Next, update the project description in the `package.json` file. This will help others understand what your project is about when they view it on GitHub or other platforms.

### 3. Update the environment variables

In order to ensure maximum security, Necomify makes use of environment variables to store sensitive information such as API keys and secrets. Make sure to update the `.env` file with your own values.

#### Important environment variables to update:

1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`: The endpoint of your AppWrite server.
2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`: The ID of your AppWrite project.
3. `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_USERS_COLLECTION_ID`: The ID of the AppWrite collection where your users are stored.
4. `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PRODUCTS_COLLECTION_ID`: The ID of the AppWrite collection where your products are stored.
5. `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_CATEGORIES_COLLECTION_ID`: The ID of the AppWrite collection where your categories are stored.
6. `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_API_KEY`: The API key for your AppWrite project.
7. `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: The publishable key for your Stripe account.
8. `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: The secret key for your Stripe account.

Make sure to update these values with your own information before deploying your project.

### 4. Edit the `README.md` file

The `README.md` file is the first thing people see when they visit your project on GitHub. Make sure to update it with relevant information about your project, how to set it up, and how to contribute.

### 5. Customize the Folder Structure

Necomify comes with a pre-built folder structure that you can customize to your needs. Make sure to organize your files and folders in a way that makes sense for your project.

### 6. Get to styling ðŸŽ‰

Now that you have set up Necomify, it's time to start customizing it to your needs. Add your own styles, components, and functionality to make it your own.
